✈️ **Sentiment Analysis of US Airline Tweets**

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project focused on tweets related to US airlines. The goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques.

🚀 Project Overview
Dataset: Publicly available tweets about US airlines.
Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings).
Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, including graphs and word clouds, to understand sentiment trends.
Modeling: A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained for binary sentiment classification (positive or negative).
Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
NLP (NLTK, SpaCy)
TensorFlow/Keras (RNN for text classification)
Scikit-learn (Model evaluation)

📊 Results
The model effectively classifies tweets based on sentiment, providing insights into customer opinions about US airlines.
